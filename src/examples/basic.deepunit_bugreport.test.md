The provided TypeScript code seems to be a collection of utility functions used throughout an application. Let's go through the functions one by one:

1. `checkFileIsNotEmpty(filePath: string)`: This function checks if a file, specified by the `filePath`, is not empty. It does so by reading the content of the file, trimming it (removing white spaces from the start and end), and checking if the result is an empty string. If an error occurs while reading the file, the function returns `false`.

2. `confirmFileIsWithinFolder(filePath: string, folderPath: string)`: This function checks if a file is located within a specific folder. It first checks if the file exists, then it resolves the absolute paths of the file and the folder. It then checks if the absolute path of the file starts with the absolute path of the folder. If the file does not exist, it returns `true`.

3. `squareNumber(num: number)`: This function is supposed to square a number, but there seems to be a bug. It currently adds the number to itself which is a multiplication by 2, not a square operation.

4. `factorial(n: number)`: This function calculates the factorial of a number, n. If the number is 0 or 1, it returns 1. If the number is negative, it throws an error.

5. `isPrime(n: number)`: This function checks if a number is a prime number.

6. `gcd(a: number, b: number)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers.

7. `fibonacci(n: number)`: This function calculates the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.

8. `circleArea(radius: number)`: This function calculates the area of a circle given its radius. If the radius is negative, it throws an error.

9. `is32Bit(num: number)`: This function checks if a given number can be represented as a 32-bit integer. It checks if the number is greater than `2,147,483,647`, and if it is, it returns `false`.

The code also imports some modules and constants, but they are not used in the provided code. The `multiply` function from './testUtils' and `checkIfFileExists` function from './subfolder/file' are imported but not used. The `SMALL_NUMBER` constant from './subfolder/consts/tests.consts' is also imported but not used.
