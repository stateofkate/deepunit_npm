Bug 1 (:red_square:): `ApiPaths.generate` is missing error handling

  - **Bug:** The `Api.generateTest` method does not handle errors returned by the API when calling the `generate-test/new` endpoint.
  
  - **Issue:** If the API returns an error, the method will not catch it and will not provide any useful information to the caller.
  
  - **Solution:** Add error handling to catch any errors returned by the API and provide a meaningful error message or propagate the error to the caller.
  
  - **Test Cases:** Test the `generateTest` method with a scenario where the API returns an error and verify that the error is handled correctly.

Bug 2 (:yellow_square:): `ApiPaths.fixErrors` is missing error handling

  - **Bug:** The `Api.fixErrors` method does not handle errors returned by the API when calling the `generate-test/fix-many-errors` endpoint.
  
  - **Issue:** If the API returns an error, the method will not catch it and will not provide any useful information to the caller.
  
  - **Solution:** Add error handling to catch any errors returned by the API and provide a meaningful error message or propagate the error to the caller.
  
  - **Test Cases:** Test the `fixErrors` method with a scenario where the API returns an error and verify that the error is handled correctly.

Bug 3 (:yellow_square:): Unused variable `mockGenerationApiResponse`

  - **Bug:** The variable `mockGenerationApiResponse` is declared but never used in the code.
  
  - **Issue:** This variable serves no purpose and should be removed to improve code readability.
  
  - **Solution:** Remove the declaration of the `mockGenerationApiResponse` variable.
  
  - **Test Cases:** No test cases are needed for this bug as it is a simple code cleanup task.

Bug 4 (:green_square:): Unused import of `AxiosError`

  - **Bug:** The import statement `import { AxiosError } from 'axios';` is not used in the code.
  
  - **Issue:** This import statement is unnecessary and should be removed to improve code readability.
  
  - **Solution:** Remove the import statement for `AxiosError`.
  
  - **Test Cases:** No test cases are needed for this bug as it is a simple code cleanup task.
